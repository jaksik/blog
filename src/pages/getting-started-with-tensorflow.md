Machine learning is no doubt becoming more relevant in our every day lives. It's very common for people to believe that creating machine learning algorithms is completely out of their reach. Luckily in the past several years this part of the tech industry has rapidly developed and became much more possible for the average developer to use. Technologies like TensorFlow.js have come to fruition and now we can create machine learning algorithms with JavaScript.

TensorFlow.js is a library for developing and training ML models in JavaScript, and deploying in browser or on Node.js.
